            Welcome to my technical documentation, where I will be sharing the knowledge and skills I have acquired throughout the semester. Over the past few months, I have learned the fundamentals of web development, version control, and server management, which have been integral to my journey in the field of technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this documentation, I will cover the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which are essential for creating and styling web pages. Additionally, I will discuss how to install Git, a version control system, and how to use GitHub, a platform for hosting Git repositories, for managing and tracking changes in files.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will also explain how to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which allows running a Linux distribution alongside Windows, and how to create a server using Ngrok, a tool for exposing a local server to the internet. These skills have been invaluable in my learning journey and will be beneficial for my future projects and career in technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this documentation will serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn the basics of web development, version control, and server management. Let's dive in!

          <p>Before diving into this documentation, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of computer operations and terminology. Additionally, it would be beneficial if you are familiar with the following concepts:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Basic knowledge of using a text editor for writing and editing code.
            </li>
            <li>Understanding of file management and directory structures.</li>
            <li>
              Familiarity with using the command line interface (CLI) for executing commands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Basic understanding of internet and web concepts such as URLs and web browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior exposure to programming concepts would be helpful but is not required.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While not mandatory, having a grasp of these concepts will make it easier to follow along with the topics covered in this documentation. If you are new to any of these concepts, don't worry! This documentation is designed to be beginner-friendly, and I will do my best to explain each topic in a clear and concise manner.
